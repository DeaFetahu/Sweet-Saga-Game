This is a game I created using PixiJS <br><br>
To get started you need to: <br>
  1. Clone the code in your desired folder
  2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
  3. Open the terminal
  4. Write the following command :<b> npm i </b>
  5. Lastly you can go ahead and open the project writing the command:<b> npm start </b>

To play the game is simple: you need to <b> click </b> on the candies you want to swap places so you match 3 or more of them!
